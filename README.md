# Audio-Visual Speech Recognition System
Project Structure
AudioFile.py
Handles operations related to managing and processing audio files, such as reading or writing .wav and .mp3 files.

FaceRecognition.py
Implements face recognition using computer vision techniques. Likely uses a library like OpenCV or a deep learning model to detect and recognize faces.

LiveSpeech.py
Captures live audio input and processes it for speech recognition. This module likely interfaces with a speech-to-text API or uses offline methods for converting speech to text.

TextToSpeech.py
Converts textual responses to speech and outputs an audio file (.mp3). Utilizes text-to-speech libraries such as Google TTS or pyttsx3.

Step6.py
Specific script related to a particular functionality in the system. This needs further clarification.

Sports.wav
Example audio file used for testing purposes.

response.mp3
Audio output of the system, typically the result of the text-to-speech module.
